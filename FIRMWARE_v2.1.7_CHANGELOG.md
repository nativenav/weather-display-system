# Weather Display Integrated v2.1.7 - Changelog

## Corrected Degree Symbols
**Release Date**: December 10, 2024  
**Focus**: Fixed degree symbols to use proper outline circles instead of filled circles

---

## üîß Critical Fix

### Issue with v2.1.6
- Degree symbols appeared as **filled circles** instead of proper degree symbols
- This looked incorrect and unprofessional on the ePaper display
- Feedback indicated filled circles were wrong for degree symbol representation

### Solution in v2.1.7
- **Reverted to outline circles**: Changed from `fillCircle` back to `drawCircle`
- **Enhanced thickness**: Added double circle technique (3px + 2px radii) for thicker outline
- **Maintained improvements**: Kept bigger size and better positioning from v2.1.6
- **Proper appearance**: Now shows hollow circles with thick outlines - correct degree symbol representation

## üé® Visual Improvements

### Corrected Degree Symbol Implementation
```cpp
// Wind Direction Degree Symbol
int centerX = x + textWidth + 3;
int centerY = y - 4;
epaper.drawCircle(centerX, centerY, 3, TFT_BLACK);  // Main circle
epaper.drawCircle(centerX, centerY, 2, TFT_BLACK);  // Inner circle for thickness

// Temperature Degree Symbol  
int tempCenterX = x + tempTextWidth + 3;
int tempCenterY = y - 4;
epaper.drawCircle(tempCenterX, tempCenterY, 3, TFT_BLACK);  // Main circle
epaper.drawCircle(tempCenterX, tempCenterY, 2, TFT_BLACK);  // Inner circle for thickness
```

### Before vs After Comparison
| Aspect | v2.1.6 (WRONG) | v2.1.7 (CORRECT) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Symbol Type | Filled circle ‚óè | Hollow circle with thick outline ‚óã | Proper degree symbol |
| Appearance | Solid black dot | Ring with thick outline | Professional and accurate |
| Visibility | Too bold, distracting | Clear but appropriate | Better visual balance |
| Technical Accuracy | Incorrect symbol | Correct degree symbol | Matches standard conventions |

## üîß Technical Fixes

### Code Improvements
- **Fixed variable conflicts**: Resolved `centerX`/`centerY` redeclaration errors
- **Proper scoping**: Used `tempCenterX`/`tempCenterY` for temperature degree symbol
- **Enhanced comments**: Updated to reflect "thicker outline" instead of "filled"
- **Maintained positioning**: Kept optimal 4px lower placement from v2.1.6

### Compilation Success
- **Flash Memory**: 1,206,272 bytes (92% of 1,310,720 bytes available)
- **Dynamic Memory**: 37,392 bytes (11% of 327,680 bytes available)
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Successful compilation and upload

## üìä System Performance

### Display Quality
- **Proper degree symbols**: Now correctly shows hollow circles with thick outlines
- **No performance impact**: Double circle drawing adds negligible overhead
- **Battery life**: Unchanged from v2.1.6 (excellent power optimization maintained)
- **Visual balance**: Degree symbols are visible but not overpowering

### Expected Display Output
**Wind Direction**: `Wind Dir: 247‚óã` (thick hollow circle)  
**Air Temperature**: `Air Temp: 8.3‚óãC` (thick hollow circle before C)

## üîÑ Migration from v2.1.6

### Critical Fix
- **Immediate visual improvement**: Degree symbols now look correct
- **No functionality changes**: All other features remain identical
- **Drop-in replacement**: Direct upgrade with no configuration needed

### Deployment
1. **Flash v2.1.7 firmware** to ESP32C3 device
2. **Verify degree symbols**: Should show as thick hollow circles, not filled dots
3. **Confirm positioning**: Symbols should be appropriately sized and positioned
4. **Serial output**: Should show "v2.1.7 corrected degree symbols"

## ‚úÖ Production Status

**v2.1.7** is the **corrected production version** with:
- ‚úÖ **Proper degree symbols** - Hollow circles with thick outlines
- ‚úÖ **Professional appearance** - Visually correct and balanced
- ‚úÖ **All v2.1.6 enhancements** - Bigger size and better positioning maintained
- ‚úÖ **Power optimizations** - All battery life improvements from previous versions
- ‚úÖ **Stable compilation** - 92% flash usage, clean build
- ‚úÖ **Ready for deployment** - Immediate replacement for v2.1.6

## üè∑Ô∏è Version History

**v2.1.7** corrects the degree symbol implementation:
- **v2.1.7**: Corrected degree symbols (hollow circles with thick outlines) ‚Üê **CURRENT**
- **v2.1.6**: Enhanced degree symbols (filled circles - incorrect)
- **v2.1.5**: Battery & aesthetic optimizations with degree symbol introduction
- **v2.1.4**: Enhanced visual hierarchy with horizontal lines
- **Previous versions**: Foundation features and optimizations

---

**Summary**: v2.1.7 delivers the correct degree symbol implementation that was intended in v2.1.6 - thick, hollow circles that properly represent degree symbols while maintaining all the size and positioning improvements for optimal visibility on the ePaper display.
