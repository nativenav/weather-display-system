# Weather Display Integrated v2.1.6 - Changelog

## Enhanced Degree Symbols
**Release Date**: December 10, 2024  
**Focus**: Improved visibility and aesthetics of degree symbols for temperature and wind direction

---

## üé® Visual Improvements

### Enhanced Degree Symbol Display
- **Bigger degree symbols**: Increased radius from 2 to 3 pixels for better visibility
- **Bolder appearance**: Changed from outline circles (`drawCircle`) to filled circles (`fillCircle`)
- **Optimized positioning**: Lowered degree symbols by 4 pixels (from `y-8` to `y-4`) for better visual alignment
- **Professional appearance**: Degree symbols now stand out clearly against the ePaper background

### Before vs After Comparison
| Aspect | v2.1.5 | v2.1.6 | Improvement |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Symbol Size | 2px radius outline | 3px radius filled | 50% larger, much bolder |
| Visibility | Thin circle, sometimes faint | Thick filled circle | Significantly improved |
| Position | 8px above baseline | 4px above baseline | Better aligned with text |
| Visual Impact | Subtle, hard to see | Prominent, clear | Professional appearance |

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Code Changes
Enhanced two key functions for degree symbol rendering:

#### Wind Direction Degree Symbol
```cpp
// v2.1.6: Wind direction with enhanced degree symbol (bigger, bolder, lower)
String windDirText = "Wind Dir: " + String(stations[i].windDirection);
epaper.drawString(windDirText, x, y);
// Draw degree symbol as bigger, bolder filled circle after the number
int textWidth = epaper.textWidth(windDirText);
epaper.fillCircle(x + textWidth + 3, y - 4, 3, TFT_BLACK);
```

#### Temperature Degree Symbol
```cpp
// v2.1.6: Temperature with enhanced degree symbol (bigger, bolder, lower)
String tempDisplay = "Air Temp: " + tempValue;
epaper.drawString(tempDisplay, x, y);
// Draw degree symbol as bigger, bolder filled circle after the temperature value
int tempTextWidth = epaper.textWidth(tempDisplay);
epaper.fillCircle(x + tempTextWidth + 3, y - 4, 3, TFT_BLACK);
// Draw 'C' after degree symbol
epaper.drawString("C", x + tempTextWidth + 8, y);
```

### Version Updates
- **Updated firmware version** throughout codebase to v2.1.6
- **Updated config.h** version constants
- **Updated User-Agent** string for backend compatibility
- **Updated serial output** messages and debug information

## üìä System Performance

### Memory Usage (Unchanged)
- **Flash Memory**: 1,205,632 bytes (91% of 1,310,720 bytes available)
- **Dynamic Memory**: 37,392 bytes (11% of 327,680 bytes available)
- **Free Heap**: ~290,288 bytes available for runtime operations

### Display Impact
- **No performance impact**: Filled circles are no more expensive than outline circles
- **Same refresh speed**: Display update timing remains identical
- **Battery life**: No change to power consumption
- **Visual quality**: Significantly improved readability

---

## üåê Backend Compatibility

### API Integration
- **Maintains full v2.0.0+ backend compatibility**
- **Updated User-Agent**: `WeatherDisplay/2.1.6 ESP32C3-{deviceId}`
- **No API changes required**: This is purely a display enhancement
- **Device registration**: Compatible with existing backend infrastructure

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Deployment

### Build Process
```bash
# Compile firmware
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:XIAO_ESP32C3 .

# Upload to device (when connected)
arduino-cli upload -p /dev/cu.usbmodem* --fqbn esp32:esp32:XIAO_ESP32C3 .
```

### Required Libraries (No Changes)
- **ArduinoJson** >= 6.19.0 (JSON parsing)
- **Seeed_GFX** (ePaper display with enhanced circle drawing)
- **ESP32 Arduino Core** (WiFi, HTTP, deep sleep)
- **Preferences** (persistent storage)

---

## üîç Testing & Validation

### Visual Verification
After deployment, degree symbols should appear as:

**Wind Direction Display**:
```
Wind Dir: 247¬∞  ‚Üê Bigger, bolder, lower positioned degree symbol
```

**Temperature Display**:
```
Air Temp: 8.3¬∞C  ‚Üê Enhanced degree symbol before 'C'
```

### Serial Output Verification
Expected startup sequence includes:
```
===========================================
  Weather Display Integrated v2.1.6
  XIAO ESP32C3 + 7.5" ePaper Display
  Enhanced Degree Symbols
  Backend API v2.0.0+ Compatible
===========================================

Refreshing ePaper display with v2.1.6 enhanced degree symbols...
*** v2.1.6 BATTERY OPTIMIZED ANTI-GHOSTING ***
```

## üîÑ Migration from v2.1.5

### Breaking Changes
- **None**: This is a pure visual enhancement

### Visual Improvements
- **Enhanced degree symbols**: Immediately visible improvement in display quality
- **Better readability**: Degree symbols now clearly distinguish temperature and direction units
- **Professional appearance**: More polished, easier to read at a distance

### Deployment Steps
1. **Compile and upload** new firmware to ESP32C3 device
2. **Verify visual improvement** - degree symbols should be noticeably bigger and bolder
3. **Confirm positioning** - degree symbols should be lower and better aligned
4. **Test in various lighting** - filled circles improve visibility in all conditions
